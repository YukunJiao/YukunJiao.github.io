A very simple assumption is that \\(f\\) is linear in \\(X\\) (linear model):\n\n\\[\nf(X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_p X_p\n\\]\n\nAfter a model has been selected, we need a procedure that uses the training data to fit or train the model. We need to estimate the parameters \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_p\\)\n\nThat is\n\\[\nY \\approx \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_p X_p\n\\]\nThe most common approach to fitting the model is referred to as ordinary least squares (OLS).\n\n\nNon-Parametric Methods\nNon-parametric methods do not make explicit assumptions about the functional form of \\(f\\). Instead they seek an estimate of \\(f\\).\nSince they do not reduce the problem of estimating \\(f\\) to a small number of parameters, a very large number of observations (far more than is typically needed for a parametric approach) is required in order to obtain an accurate estimate for \\(f\\).\n\nthin-plate spline\n\nMore details in Chapter 7\n\n\n\n2.1.3 The Trade-Off Between Prediction Accuracy and Model Interpretability\nOne question: Why would we ever choose to use a more restrictive method instead of a very flexible approach?\nAnswer: We might choose a more restrictive method because it is easier to interpret. When our goal is inference, understanding the relationship between each predictor and the response is important, and very flexible methods can produce estimates that are too complex to interpret.\nSurprisingly, this is not always the case! We will often obtain more accurate predictions using a less flexible method. (due to overfitting in highly flexbile methods)\n\n\n2.1.5 Regression Versus Classification Problems\nChoice of statistical learning method mainly depends on the type of response:\n\nQuantitative response → linear regression\nQualitative response → logistic regression\n\nPredictor type (quantitative or qualitative) is generally less important, as long as any qualitative predictors are properly coded before analysis.\n\n\n2.2.1 Measuring the Quality of Fit\nWe need to quantify the extent to which the predicted response value for a given observation is close to the true response value for that observation. In the regression setting, the most commonly-used measure is the mean squared error (MSE):\n\\[\n\\mathrm{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\big(y_i - \\hat{f}(x_i)\\big)^2\n\\] But this MSE above is training MSE, which we don’t care about.\nWe are interested in the accuracy of the predictions that we obtain when we apply our method to previously unseen test data.\nThus, we could compute the average squared prediction error for these test observations \\((x_0, y_0)\\):\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Ave}\\big( (y_0 - \\hat{f}(x_0))^2 \\big)\n\\]\nwhere \\((x_0, y_0)\\) is a previously unseen test observation not used to train the statistical learning method.\nAs model flexibility increases, the training MSE will decrease, but the test MSE may not. When a given method yields a small training MSE but a large test MSE, we are said to be overfitting the data.\nOne important method is cross-validation (Chapter 5), which is a method for estimating the test MSE using the training data.\n\n\n2.2.2 The Bias-Variance Trade-Off\nFor a given value \\(x_0\\), the expected test MSE can always be decomposed into the sum of three fundamental quantities: the variance of \\(\\hat{f}(x_0)\\), the squared bias of \\(\\hat{f}(x_0)\\), and the variance of the error terms \\(\\epsilon\\)\nThat is (bias–variance trade-off)\n\\[\nE\\big( y_0 - \\hat{f}(x_0) \\big)^2\n= \\mathrm{Var}\\big(\\hat{f}(x_0)\\big)\n+ \\big[ \\mathrm{Bias}\\big(\\hat{f}(x_0)\\big) \\big]^2\n+ \\mathrm{Var}(\\epsilon)\n\\]\nThis equation tells us that in order to minimize the expected test error, we need to select a statistical learning method that simultaneously achieves low variance and low bias.\nvariance — the amount by which \\(\\hat{f}\\) would change if we estimated it using a different training data set\nIn general, more flexible statistical methods have higher variance.\nbias — the error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem, which may be extremely complicated, by a much simpler model\nIn general, more flexible methods result in less bias.\n\n\n2.2.3 The Classification Setting\ntraining error rate (the fraction of incorrect classifications)\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} I(y_i \\neq \\hat{y}_i)\n\\] Here, \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is the predicted class label for the \\(i\\)th observation using \\(\\hat{f}\\). And \\(I(y_i \\neq \\hat{y}_i)\\) is an indicator variable that equals 1 if \\(y_i \\neq \\hat{y}_i\\) and 0 if \\(y_i = \\hat{y}_i\\). If \\(I(y_i \\neq \\hat{y}_i) = 0\\), then the \\(i\\)th observation was classified correctly by our classification method; otherwise it was misclassified.\ntest error rate\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Ave}\\big(I(y_0 \\neq \\hat{y}_0)\\big)\n\\]"

This procedure is repeated for \\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\).\nRepeating this approach \\(n\\) times produces \\(n\\) squared errors, \\(\\mathrm{MSE}_1, \\dots, \\mathrm{MSE}_n\\). The LOOCV estimate for the test \\(\\mathrm{MSE}\\) is the average of these \\(n\\) test error estimates:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{CV}(n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathrm{MSE}_i\n\\] With least squares linear or polynomial regression:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{CV}(n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{y_i - \\hat{y}_i}{1 - h_i} \\right)^2\n\\] where \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is the \\(i\\)th fitted value from the original least squares fit, and \\(h_i\\) is the leverage defined in (3.37) on page 99.\n\n\nk-Fold Cross-Validation\nk-fold CV involves randomly dividing the set of observations into k groups, or folds, of approximately equal size.\nThe \\(k\\)-fold CV estimate is computed by averaging these values:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{CV}(k) = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\mathrm{MSE}_i.\n\\]\nLOOCV is a special case of k-fold CV in which k is set to equal n.\nIn practice, one typically performs k-fold CV using k = 5 or k = 10.\nThe goal here is to identify the method that results in the lowest test error; for this purpose, the location of the minimum point on the estimated test \\(\\mathrm{MSE}\\) curve is important, while the actual value of the estimated \\(\\mathrm{MSE}\\) is not important.\n\n\nBias-Variance Trade-Off for k-Fold Cross-Validation\nLOOCV — low bias (approximately unbiased estimates) but high variance!\nSince the mean of many highly correlated quantities has higher variance than does the mean of many quantities that are not as highly correlated, the test error estimate resulting from LOOCV tends to have higher variance than does the test error estimate resulting from k-fold CV.\n\n\nCross-Validation on Classification Problems\nIn the classification setting, the LOOCV error rate takes the form\n\\[\n\\mathrm{CV}_{(n)} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathrm{Err}_i\n\\] where \\(\\mathrm{Err}_i = I(y_i \\neq \\hat{y}_i)\\)\nIn practice, for real data, the Bayes decision boundary and the test error rates are unknown. So how might we decide between the four logistic regression models displayed in Figure 5.7? We can use cross-validation in order to make this decision."

Ridge regression will perform better when the response is a function of many predictors, all with coefficients of roughly equal size. However, the number of predictors that is related to the response is never known a priori for real data sets. A technique such as cross-validation can be used in order to determine which approach is better on a particular data set.\nmy question — why fig 6.9. plots against \\(R^2\\)?\nA Simple Special Case for Ridge Regression and the Lasso\n\nridge regression more or less shrinks every dimension of the data by the same proportion, whereas the lasso more or less shrinks all coefficients toward zero by a similar amount, and sufficiently small coefficients are shrunken all the way to zero.\n\n\n\nSelecting the Tuning Parameter\nBy cross-validation\n\n\n\nConsiderations in High Dimensions\nhigh-dimensional setting — the case where the number of features \\(p\\) is larger than the number of observations \\(n\\)\n\nWhat Goes Wrong in High Dimensions?\nThe problem is simple: when \\(p &gt; n\\) or \\(p \\approx n\\), a simple least squares regression line is too flexible and hence overfits the data.\nIn high-dimensional settings (when \\(p \\ge n\\)), traditional methods for adjusting training set error or \\(R^2\\)—like \\(C_p\\), \\(\\mathrm{AIC}\\), \\(\\mathrm{BIC}\\), or adjusted \\(R^2\\)—fail because estimating \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) becomes unreliable, and adjusted \\(R^2\\) can misleadingly reach 1. Therefore, specialized methods are needed for analyzing high-dimensional data.\n\n\nRegression in High Dimensions\nEssentially, these approaches (ridge regression, lasso) avoid overfitting by using a less flexible fitting approach than least squares.\n\nregularization or shrinkage plays a key role in high-dimensional problems,\nappropriate tuning parameter selection is crucial for good predictive performance,\nthe test error tends to increase as the dimensionality of the problem (i.e. the number of features or predictors) increases, unless the additional features are truly associated with the response.\n\ncurse of dimensionality — they can lead to improved predictive models if these features are in fact relevant to the problem at hand, but will lead to worse results if the features are not relevant. Even if they are relevant, the variance incurred in fitting their coefficients may outweigh the reduction in bias that they bring.\n\n\nInterpreting Results in High Dimensions\nmulticollinearity — the variables in a regression might be correlated with each other\nIn the high-dimensional setting, the multicollinearity problem is extreme: any variable in the model can be written as a linear combination of all of the other variables in the model.\nTo make it clear that what we have identified is simply one of many possible models for predicting blood pressure, and that it must be further validated on independent data sets.\nIt is also important to be particularly careful in reporting errors and measures of model fit in the high-dimensional setting. We have seen that when \\(p &gt; n\\), it is easy to obtain a useless model that has zero residuals. Therefore, one should never use sum of squared errors, p-values, \\(R^2\\) statistics, or other traditional measures of model fit on the training data as evidence of a good model fit in the high-dimensional setting.\nIt is important to instead report results on an independent test set, or cross-validation errors. For instance, the MSE or R² on an independent test set is a valid measure of model fit, but the MSE on the training set certainly is not."
